### An App to save phone Contacts

### WIP :
it's a work in progress.  ;-)

### v0.1 Changes Notes :
- on this commit the main UI was designed. <br/> 
- Now there is a form for creating and updating a contact, a datagrid that will soon contain the added contacts list, with a search bar and some buttons. <br/> 
- also designed and added a logo and an icon :-)
